React Redux Cart
React Redux Cart is a shopping cart application built using React and Redux. It allows users to add items to their cart, remove single items, and clear the entire cart. The application utilizes the useDispatch and useSelector hooks from the react-redux library for state management.

Features
Add items to the cart: Users can add items to their shopping cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.
Remove single items: Users can remove individual items from their cart by clicking the "Remove" button next to each item.
Clear the cart: Users can remove all items from the cart by clicking the "Clear Cart" button.
Navigation: The application uses the useNavigate hook from react-router-dom to redirect users to different routes within the application.
URL Parameters: The useParams hook is used to retrieve values passed in the URL, allowing for dynamic routing and rendering of components.
